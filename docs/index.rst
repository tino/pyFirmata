Welcome to pyFirmata's documentation!
=====================================

Module reference:

   pyfirmata

Installation
============

The preferred way to install is with pip_::

    pip install pyfirmata

If you install from source with ``python setup.py install``, don't forget to install ``pyserial`` as well.

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/

Usage
=====

Basic usage::

    >>> from pyfirmata import Arduino, util
    >>> board = Arduino('/dev/tty.usbserial-A6008rIF')
    >>> board.digital[13].write(1)

To use analog ports, it is probably handy to start an iterator thread. Otherwise the board will keep sending data to your serial, until it overflows::

    >>> it = util.Iterator(board)
    >>> it.start()
    >>> board.analog[0].enable_reporting()
    >>> board.analog[0].read()
    0.661440304938

If you use a pin more often, it can be worth it to use the ``get_pin`` method of the board. It let's you specify what pin you need by a string, composed of 'a' or 'd' (depending on wether you need an analog or digital pin), the pin number, and the mode ('i' for input, 'o' for output, 'p' for pwm). All seperated by ``:``. Eg. ``a:0:i`` for analog 0 as input, or ``d:3:p`` for digital pin 3 as pwm.::

    >>> analog_0 = board.get_pin('a:0:i')
    >>> analog_0.read()
    0.661440304938
    >>> pin3 = board.get_pin('d:3:p')
    >>> pin3.write(0.6)

Board layout
============

If you want to use a board with a different layout than the standard Arduino, or the Arduino Mega (for which there exist the shortcut classes ``pyfirmata.Arduino`` and ``pyfirmata.ArduinoMega``), instantiate the Board class with a dictionary as the ``layout`` argument. This is the layout dict for the Mega for example::

    >>> mega = {
    ...         'digital' : tuple(x for x in range(54)),
    ...         'analog' : tuple(x for x in range(16)),
    ...         'pwm' : tuple(x for x in range(2,14)),
    ...         'use_ports' : True,
    ...         'disabled' : (0, 1, 14, 15) # Rx, Tx, Crystal
    ...         }
