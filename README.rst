pyFirmata
=========

pyFirmata is a Python interface for the `Firmata`_ protocol.

Installation
============

The preferred way to install is with pip_::

    pip install pyfirmata

If you install from source with ``python setup.py install``, don't forget to
install `pyserial`_ as well.::

    git clone https://github.com/tino/pyFirmata
    cd pyFirmata
    pip install pyserial
    python setup.py install

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/
.. _pyserial:http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/

Usage
=====

Basic usage::

    >>> from pyfirmata import Arduino, util
    >>> board = Arduino('/dev/tty.usbserial-A6008rIF')
    >>> board.digital[13].write(1)

To use analog ports, it is probably handy to start an iterator thread. 
Otherwise the board will keep sending data to your serial, until it overflows::

    >>> it = util.Iterator(board)
    >>> it.start()
    >>> board.analog[0].enable_reporting()
    >>> board.analog[0].read()
    0.661440304938

If you use a pin more often, it can be worth it to use the ``get_pin`` method
of the board. It let's you specify what pin you need by a string, composed of
'a' or 'd' (depending on wether you need an analog or digital pin), the pin
number, and the mode ('i' for input, 'o' for output, 'p' for pwm). All
seperated by ``:``. Eg. ``a:0:i`` for analog 0 as input or ``d:3:p`` for
digital pin 3 as pwm.::

    >>> analog_0 = board.get_pin('a:0:i')
    >>> analog_0.read()
    0.661440304938
    >>> pin3 = board.get_pin('d:3:p')
    >>> pin3.write(0.6)

Board layout
============

If you want to use a board with a different layout than the standard Arduino,
or the Arduino Mega (for wich there exist the shortcut classes 
``pyfirmata.Arduino`` and ``pyfirmata.ArduinoMega``), instantiate the Board 
class with a dictionary as the ``layout`` argument. This is the layout dict 
for the Mega for example::

    >>> mega = {
    ...         'digital' : tuple(x for x in range(54)),
    ...         'analog' : tuple(x for x in range(16)),
    ...         'pwm' : tuple(x for x in range(2,14)),
    ...         'use_ports' : True,
    ...         'disabled' : (0, 1, 14, 15) # Rx, Tx, Crystal
    ...         }

Todo
====

The next things on my list are to implement the new protocol changes in firmata:

- Capability Query, which would eliminate the need to instantiate a board with
  the layout dict, as it will be able to determine the layout itself
  (http://firmata.org/wiki/Proposals#Capability_Query_.28added_in_version_2.2.29)
- Pin State Query, which allows it to populate on-screen controls with an
  accurate representation of the hardware's configuration
  (http://firmata.org/wiki/Proposals#Pin_State_Query_.28added_in_version_2.2.29)
