pyFirmata
=========

pyFirmata is a Python interface for the `Firmata`_ protocol. It is fully
compatible with Firmata 2.1, and has some functionality of version 2.2. It runs
on Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.

Installation
============

The preferred way to install is with pip_::

    pip3 install pyfirmata

You can also install from source with ``python setup.py install``. You will
need to have `setuptools`_ installed::

    git clone https://github.com/tino/pyFirmata
    cd pyFirmata
    python3 setup.py install

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/
.. _setuptools: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools


Usage
=====

Basic usage::

    >>> from pyfirmata import Arduino, util
    >>> board = Arduino('/dev/tty.usbserial-A6008rIF')
    >>> board.digital[13].write(1)

To switch on data acquisition from the inputs of the board run::

    >>> board.samplingOn()

and they will be updated approximately every 19ms. Or enable sampling
with the exact sampling rate (max 100Hz)::

    >>> board.samplingOn(samplingrate in Hz)

The individual analoge pins are enabled / read by:

    >>> board.analog[0].enable_reporting()
    >>> board.analog[0].read()
    0.661440304938

In order to get the data at the given sampling rate you can register a callback
handler::
  
    >>> board.analog[0].register_callback(myCallback)
    
where myCallback(data) is then called every time when data has been received
and is timed by the arduino itself so is very precise of up about 100Hz
sampling rate.

If you use a pin more often, it can be worth it to use the ``get_pin`` method
of the board. It let's you specify what pin you need by a string, composed of
'a' or 'd' (depending on wether you need an analog or digital pin), the pin
number, and the mode ('i' for input, 'o' for output, 'p' for pwm). All
seperated by ``:``. Eg. ``a:0:i`` for analog 0 as input or ``d:3:p`` for
digital pin 3 as pwm.::

    >>> analog_0 = board.get_pin('a:0:i')
    >>> analog_0.read()
    0.661440304938
    >>> pin3 = board.get_pin('d:3:p')
    >>> pin3.write(0.6)

Board layout
============

If you want to use a board with a different layout than the standard Arduino
or the Arduino Mega (for which there exist the shortcut classes
``pyfirmata.Arduino`` and ``pyfirmata.ArduinoMega``), instantiate the Board
class with a dictionary as the ``layout`` argument. This is the layout dict
for the Mega for example::

    >>> mega = {
    ...         'digital' : tuple(x for x in range(54)),
    ...         'analog' : tuple(x for x in range(16)),
    ...         'pwm' : tuple(x for x in range(2,14)),
    ...         'use_ports' : True,
    ...         'disabled' : (0, 1, 14, 15) # Rx, Tx, Crystal
    ...         }

Todo
====

The next things on my list are to implement the new protocol changes in
firmata:

- Pin State Query, which allows it to populate on-screen controls with an
  accurate representation of the hardware's configuration
